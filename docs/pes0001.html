Most numerical values appear to be 16 bit ints and are shown as such in this document, unless otherwise noted.
All characters appear to be ascii.

#PES0001 (16 bytes in this section)
1. address of section UNKNOWN01 start (this is a UInt32) (UNKNOWN01 is the name I gave it until I find out what it does)
2. a value of 1 here seems to indicate design data is over 100KB long, or 0 for less than 100KB
3. 1 (the rest of the fields in this section appear to be always the same; they also match the ending fields of the next section)

Start stitch blocks 
Block:
    (color start indicator) (all color changes have the same value for this field; if the value here is not the same as the first block, it's not a color change)
    (color index)
    (number of stitches in this block)
    (x value)
    (y value)
    (x value)
    (y value)
    (x value)
    ...
    -32765 (block seperator or joiner) (03 80 in hex, 32771 as UInt16)
(block)
(block seperator)
(block)
(block seperator)
...
when you read all the stitches for a block and the next value is not a block seperator, stitch blocks are done (I think)
Start color table: 
    (color index)
    (number of blocks before next color change?)
    (color index)
    (number of blocks)
    ...
    This block ends with 0 0 (00 00 in hex)
After the color table should be 16716 (LA in char, 4C 41 in hex) which seems to signal the start of section UNKNOWN01
